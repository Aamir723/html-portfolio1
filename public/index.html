<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p>In 1998, senior Paul Edgecomb lives in a retirement home. He suddenly starts crying on community television when Fred Astaire sings the song Cheek to Cheek in the film I Dance Myself into Your Heart. Paul tells his sympathetic roommate and friend Elaine why this film touches him so much. His memories go back to the 1930s. At the time, Paul was 44 years old and the head of death row at Cold Mountain, Louisiana, who was nicknamed "the Green Mile" because of the color of his linoleumfloor. Together with his colleagues, Paul had the task of guarding those sentenced to death and carrying out their execution in the electric chair.
In 1935, a new prisoner, John Coffey, was transferred to death row. Coffey is a six-meter-tall, extremely muscular and scarred African-American who has been convicted of rape and murder of two little white girls. He doesn't seem very intelligent and speaks only in short and simple sentences. While the guards are still afraid of him at the beginning, it quickly becomes apparent that the outward appearance does not reflect his true nature: In fact, he is a gentle giant with a na√Øve nature and fear of the dark, who never uses violence or even threats against anyone. He is always polite and does what he is told. But there's more to it than that. When the psychopath William Wharton (nicknamed "Billy the Kid") is admitted, he warns the guards about him. Without knowing him, he immediately sensed his deviousness and realized that William Wharton was trying to deceive the guards, which he did.</p>
<h3>The Edge</h3>
<p>Photographer Robert Green is supposed to take photos of the model Mickey Morse in Alaska. She is accompanied by her elderly and rich husband Charles Morse, who soon realizes that she is cheating on him with the photographer. When Robert sees an old Indian in a photo, he wants to take a series of photos of him. Since the Indian lives on a distant lake, he takes a flight to this lake with Charles, his assistant Stephen and the pilot. A note on his front door indicates that the Indian is hunting bears miles away.</p>
<h3>Troy</h3>
